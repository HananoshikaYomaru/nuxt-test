# Nuxt test

this repo is simple testing app for me to test out Vue and Nuxt. Sadly it doesn't go well and I lost my patient.

# Learning

1. Nuxt js is a meta framewor for vue. It handles installation of packages using plugins but the plugins is not well maintained.

2. Nuxt doesn't handle typescript well. This make DX very bad especially when there is import error. Nuxt use "magic import" by default and the magic is just too magic. When there is error, you have no way to fix it unless you do not use the magic import.

3. The number of UI library is far less than that in React, not even 10% of the React community. You need to accept that you will write almost every component by yourself.
